# Welcome to the AI Supply Chain Guide

This guide was created for **Auburn University Harbert College of Business** students to learn how to use AI tools for real-world supply chain problems.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll be able to:

- **Install and use Claude Code** - An AI assistant that writes and runs code for you
- **Analyze supply chain data** - Load datasets, find patterns, identify problems
- **Build predictive models** - Predict late deliveries before they happen
- **Generate business recommendations** - Turn AI insights into actionable decisions

## No Coding Experience Required

This guide is designed for business students. You don't need to know Python, R, or any programming language. Claude Code handles the technical work - you just need to know **what questions to ask**.

## The Use Case: Fedrigoni

We'll work through a real business problem from **Fedrigoni**, an Italian company that makes premium paper and labels for wine bottles, luxury packaging, and more.

**The Problem:** 17.4% of their orders arrive late, costing €573K/year in penalties.

**Our Solution:** Use AI to predict which orders will be late, so they can intervene before it happens.
