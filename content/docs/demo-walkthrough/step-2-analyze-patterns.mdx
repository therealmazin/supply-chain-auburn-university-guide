# Step 2: Analyze Patterns

Now let's find out what makes some orders late and others on-time.

## The Prompt

Copy and paste this prompt:

```
Analyze the late delivery patterns in detail:
1. Break down late rate by product category
2. Break down late rate by facility
3. Show if order size affects late delivery rate
4. Check if there are seasonal patterns (by month)
5. Create visualizations for the most interesting findings
```

## What Claude Code Does

Claude Code will:

1. **Group the data** by different dimensions
2. **Calculate late rates** for each group
3. **Identify significant differences** between groups
4. **Create charts** to visualize the patterns

## Expected Results

### By Product Category

| Category | Orders | Late Rate |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Art_Design_Papers | 501 | **29.5%** |
| Luxury_Packaging | 1,263 | 23.4% |
| Self_Adhesive_Materials | 1,537 | 18.0% |
| Wine_Labels | 1,699 | 8.7% |

**Insight:** Art & Design Papers have 3x higher late rate than Wine Labels.

### By Facility

| Facility | Orders | Late Rate |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Sao_Paulo_BR | 1,041 | **21.9%** |
| Chicago_US | 1,035 | 19.2% |
| Barcelona_ES | 991 | 17.4% |
| Fabriano_IT | 977 | 15.1% |
| Verona_IT | 956 | 12.7% |

**Insight:** Sao Paulo facility has the highest late rate. Verona performs best.

### By Order Priority

| Priority | Orders | Late Rate |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Economy | 470 | **28.1%** |
| Standard | 2,762 | 19.7% |
| Express | 1,264 | 12.5% |
| Critical | 504 | 6.9% |

**Insight:** Economy orders get deprioritized. Critical orders rarely miss deadlines.

### By Month (Seasonal Patterns)

| Worst Months | Late Rate | Best Months | Late Rate |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| August | 25.9% | April | 11.2% |
| September | 25.2% | November | 14.8% |

**Insight:** Late summer (Aug/Sep) is the worst period for on-time delivery.

## Visualizations

Claude Code will create charts like:

- **Bar chart** showing late rate by category
- **Heatmap** showing facility x month patterns
- **Scatter plot** showing order size vs. late rate

These visuals make patterns immediately obvious.

## Key Insights from This Step

1. **Product type matters** - Some products are inherently harder to deliver on time
2. **Facility matters** - Not all factories perform equally
3. **Order size matters** - Large orders are riskier
4. **Timing matters** - Seasonal patterns exist

## Business Translation

What does this mean for Fedrigoni?

- **Art & Design Papers** need extra attention or longer lead times
- **Sao Paulo facility** may need process improvements
- **Economy orders** are being deprioritized - is this intentional?
- **August and September** require additional capacity planning

## Next Step

We've found patterns. Now let's build a model that can predict late deliveries.
