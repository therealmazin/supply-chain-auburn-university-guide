## Skills You'll Develop

By working through this demo, you'll learn:

| Skill | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| **Prompt engineering** | Communicating effectively with AI tools |
| **Data interpretation** | Understanding what results actually mean |
| **Business translation** | Converting analysis into recommendations |
| **Critical thinking** | Questioning AI outputs, not blindly trusting them |

## Career Relevance

### The AI Advantage

Companies are looking for people who can:

1. **Identify** where AI can solve business problems
2. **Communicate** requirements to technical teams (or AI tools)
3. **Interpret** results in business terms
4. **Implement** changes based on insights

This is exactly what you're learning today.

### Job Market Reality

**Traditional supply chain analyst:**
- Spends hours building spreadsheet models
- Limited to analyzing what happened (descriptive)
- Reactive to problems

**AI-augmented analyst:**
- Uses AI to build models in minutes
- Predicts what will happen (predictive)
- Proactive intervention

Which one do you want to be?

## The Bottom Line

Late deliveries are a real problem. AI can help predict them. And you can learn to use AI tools to solve problems like this.

That's the value of this demo.
