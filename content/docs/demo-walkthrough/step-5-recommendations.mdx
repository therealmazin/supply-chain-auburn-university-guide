# Step 5: Recommendations

The final step: translating analysis into business recommendations.

## The Prompt

Copy and paste this prompt:

```
Based on everything we've learned, create an executive summary with:
1. The key findings (what causes late deliveries)
2. Specific recommendations for improvement
3. Expected impact if recommendations are implemented
4. Suggested next steps for Fedrigoni

Format this as a brief report suitable for a VP of Operations.
```

## What Claude Code Does

Claude Code will synthesize all the analysis into business language:

1. **Summarize findings** - Key patterns and insights
2. **Propose actions** - Specific, actionable recommendations
3. **Quantify impact** - Expected improvements with numbers
4. **Outline next steps** - How to move forward

## Expected Output

### Executive Summary

```
FEDRIGONI LATE DELIVERY ANALYSIS
Executive Summary for VP Operations

SITUATION
- 17.4% of converting orders delivered late (868 of 5,000)
- Estimated annual cost: €573K in penalties
- Industry benchmark: <5% late delivery rate

KEY FINDINGS
1. Product Mix Impact
   - Art & Design Papers: 29.5% late (3x worse than average)
   - Wine Labels: 8.7% late (best performing)

2. Facility Performance
   - Sassoferrato: 24.1% late (worst)
   - Verona Main: 11.2% late (best)

3. Order Size Risk
   - Orders >1,000 units: 28.7% late
   - Orders <100 units: 12.1% late

4. Seasonal Patterns
   - March/September peaks correlate with higher delays
```

### Recommendations

| # | Recommendation | Expected Impact |
|---|----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Implement risk scoring** - Flag high-probability orders at intake | Catch 660 high-risk orders for proactive intervention |
| 2 | **Extend lead times for Art Papers** - Add 3-5 day buffer | Reduce Art Papers late rate from 29.5% to ~15% |
| 3 | **Investigate Sassoferrato** - Process audit and improvement | Could save €100K+ annually |
| 4 | **Capacity planning for peak months** - March/September staffing | Smooth seasonal spikes |
| 5 | **Large order protocol** - Extra monitoring for >1,000 unit orders | Reduce large order late rate by 30% |

### Projected Impact

If recommendations are implemented:

| Metric | Current | Projected | Improvement |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Overall late rate | 17.4% | 10.5% | -40% |
| Annual penalty cost | €573K | €344K | -€229K |
| Critical orders caught | 0% | 89% | +89% |

### Next Steps

1. **Week 1-2:** Deploy risk scoring model in test environment
2. **Week 3-4:** Pilot proactive intervention on High/Critical orders
3. **Month 2:** Measure impact, refine thresholds
4. **Month 3:** Full rollout and process integration

## The Power of This Approach

Notice what we just did in 5 prompts:

1. Loaded and understood the data
2. Found meaningful patterns
3. Built a predictive model
4. Validated it works
5. Generated business recommendations

**Total time:** About 15-20 minutes

**Traditional approach:** Days or weeks with Excel, SQL, and presentation building

## Key Takeaways

### For the Business
- Late deliveries are predictable
- Proactive intervention is possible
- Significant cost savings available

### For You
- AI tools can do complex analysis quickly
- The hard part is asking the right questions
- Business interpretation is still human work
