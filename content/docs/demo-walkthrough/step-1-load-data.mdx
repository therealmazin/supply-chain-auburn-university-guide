# Step 1: Load the Data

Let's start by loading the dataset and understanding what we're working with.

## Setup

1. Download the dataset from the [Try It Yourself](/docs/try-it-yourself/download-dataset) page
2. Put it in a folder (e.g., `supply-chain-demo`)
3. Open your terminal and navigate to that folder
4. Start Claude Code by typing `claude`

## The Prompt

Copy and paste this prompt:

```
Load the fedrigoni_converting_orders.csv file and give me:
1. How many orders are in the dataset
2. What columns are available
3. What percentage of orders were delivered late
4. A summary of any interesting patterns you notice
```

## What Claude Code Does

Claude Code will:

1. **Read the CSV file** using Python's pandas library
2. **Analyze the structure** - count rows, identify columns
3. **Calculate the late delivery rate** - compare actual vs promised dates
4. **Identify initial patterns** - look for obvious trends

## Expected Output

You should see something like:

```
I'll load and analyze the Fedrigoni orders dataset.

**Dataset Overview:**
- Total orders: 5,000
- Time period: January 2023 - December 2024
- Columns: 12

**Columns Available:**
- order_id: Unique identifier
- product_category: Type of product
- order_quantity: Number of units
- facility: Production facility
- order_date: When order was placed
- promised_date: When delivery was promised
- actual_delivery_date: When it actually arrived
- lead_time_days: Days from order to delivery
- is_late: Whether delivery was late (1=yes, 0=no)
- ... and more

**Late Delivery Rate:**
- On-time: 4,132 orders (82.6%)
- Late: 868 orders (17.4%)

**Initial Patterns:**
- Late rate varies significantly by product category
- Larger orders tend to have higher late rates
- Certain facilities have more delays than others
```

## Understanding the Data

### Key Columns

| Column | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| `order_id` | Unique identifier for each order |
| `product_category` | What type of product (Wine Labels, Art Papers, etc.) |
| `order_quantity` | How many units ordered |
| `facility` | Which factory handles the order |
| `is_late` | Our target variable (1 = late, 0 = on-time) |

### The Target Variable

`is_late` is what we want to predict. It's calculated by comparing:
- `promised_date` - when we told the customer
- `actual_delivery_date` - when it actually arrived

If actual > promised, the order is late.

## Why This Matters

This first step establishes:

1. **Data quality** - Is the data clean? Any missing values?
2. **Problem scope** - 17.4% late rate is significant
3. **Available features** - What information can we use for prediction?

## Next Step

Now that we understand the data, let's dig deeper into what causes late deliveries.
