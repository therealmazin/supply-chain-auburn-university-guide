# What is Claude Code?

**Claude Code** is an AI assistant that can write and run code for you. Think of it as having a data analyst on demand - you describe what you want to analyze, and it does the technical work.

## How It's Different from ChatGPT

You've probably used ChatGPT before. Here's how Claude Code is different:

| ChatGPT | Claude Code |
|---------|-------------|
| Gives advice and answers | Actually runs code on your data |
| "Here's how you could..." | "Here are your results..." |
| General knowledge | Works with your specific files |
| One-shot responses | Back-and-forth conversation |

## What Can Claude Code Do?

For supply chain work, Claude Code can:

- **Load and analyze datasets** - Import CSV/Excel files, calculate statistics
- **Find patterns** - Identify trends, seasonality, problem areas
- **Build predictive models** - Forecast demand, predict delays
- **Create visualizations** - Charts, graphs, dashboards
- **Generate reports** - Summarize findings with business recommendations

## What It Looks Like

When you use Claude Code, you have a conversation. You type questions in plain English, and it responds with analysis:

```
You: Load the orders data and tell me what percentage are delivered late

Claude Code: I'll load and analyze the dataset...
             [Runs Python code behind the scenes]

             Results:
             - Total orders: 5,000
             - On-time: 4,132 (82.6%)
             - Late: 868 (17.4%)

             The late delivery rate is 17.4%, which is above
             the industry target of 10%.
```

## Why This Matters for Your Career
