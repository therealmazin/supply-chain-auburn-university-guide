- **"Human + Machine" by Daugherty & Wilson** - AI in the enterprise

## About the Dataset

The Fedrigoni dataset used in this guide is **synthetically generated** specifically for this use case. It was designed to:

- Reflect realistic supply chain patterns and late delivery rates
- Include learnable patterns for predictive modeling
- Provide a safe, shareable dataset for educational purposes

Real company data is proprietary, so we created this simulated dataset based on industry benchmarks and realistic business scenarios.

## Keep Practicing

The best way to learn is by doing:

1. **Use Claude Code regularly** - Build the habit
2. **Try different datasets** - Find public data on Kaggle
3. **Work on real problems** - Ask professors for project data
4. **Join competitions** - Kaggle competitions are great practice
