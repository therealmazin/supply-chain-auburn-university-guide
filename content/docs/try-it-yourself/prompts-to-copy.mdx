# All Prompts

Here are all the prompts from the demo in one convenient place. Just copy and paste!

## Prompt 1: Load and Explore Data

```
Load the fedrigoni_converting_orders.csv file and give me:
1. How many orders are in the dataset
2. What columns are available
3. What percentage of orders were delivered late
4. A summary of any interesting patterns you notice
```

**What it does:** Loads the dataset and provides an initial overview.

---

## Prompt 2: Analyze Patterns

```
Analyze the late delivery patterns in detail:
1. Break down late rate by product category
2. Break down late rate by facility
3. Show if order size affects late delivery rate
4. Check if there are seasonal patterns (by month)
5. Create visualizations for the most interesting findings
```

**What it does:** Discovers which factors correlate with late deliveries.

---

## Prompt 3: Build Predictive Model

```
Build a predictive model for late deliveries:
1. Select appropriate features from the dataset
2. Split into training and testing sets
3. Train a classification model (try gradient boosting)
4. Show me the model's accuracy and key performance metrics
5. Tell me which factors are most important for predictions
```

**What it does:** Trains a machine learning model to predict late orders.

---

## Prompt 4: Validate and Score

```
Validate the model and create risk scores:
1. Score all orders with late delivery probability (0-100%)
2. Group orders into risk categories: Low, Medium, High, Critical
3. Show me the actual late rate for each risk category
4. If the model is good, higher risk groups should have higher actual late rates
5. Export a list of high-risk orders with their details
```

**What it does:** Validates predictions and creates actionable risk scores.

---

## Prompt 5: Generate Recommendations

```
Based on everything we've learned, create an executive summary with:
1. The key findings (what causes late deliveries)
2. Specific recommendations for improvement
3. Expected impact if recommendations are implemented
4. Suggested next steps for Fedrigoni

Format this as a brief report suitable for a VP of Operations.
```

**What it does:** Synthesizes analysis into business recommendations.

## Bonus Prompts

### Quick Statistics

```
Give me a quick statistical summary of the dataset -
means, medians, and standard deviations for numeric columns.
```

### Correlation Analysis

```
Show me the correlation between all numeric variables
and the late delivery indicator. Which variables have
the strongest relationship with late deliveries?
```

### Export Results

```
Export the following to separate CSV files:
1. All high-risk orders (probability > 50%)
2. Summary statistics by product category
3. Monthly late delivery trends
```

### What-If Analysis

```
If we could reduce the late rate for Art & Design Papers
from 29.5% to 15%, what would be the impact on the
overall company late delivery rate?
```

### Compare Facilities

```
Create a detailed comparison of all facilities including:
- Order volume
- Late delivery rate
- Average order size
- Product mix
Rank them from best to worst performing.
```

## Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **Run them in order** - Each prompt builds on the previous one
2. **Wait for completion** - Let Claude finish before sending the next prompt
3. **Ask follow-ups** - If something isn't clear, ask for clarification
4. **Modify as needed** - These are starting points, customize for your questions
