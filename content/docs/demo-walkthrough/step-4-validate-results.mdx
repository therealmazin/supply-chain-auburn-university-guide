# Step 4: Validate Results

Before trusting the model, we need to verify it makes sense.

## The Prompt

Copy and paste this prompt:

```
Validate the model and create risk scores:
1. Score all orders with late delivery probability (0-100%)
2. Group orders into risk categories: Low, Medium, High, Critical
3. Show me the actual late rate for each risk category
4. If the model is good, higher risk groups should have higher actual late rates
5. Export a list of high-risk orders with their details
```

## Why Validation Matters

A model can have good metrics but still be useless. We need to check:

1. **Does it make sense?** - Are predictions logical?
2. **Is it calibrated?** - Does 80% probability mean ~80% actual late rate?
3. **Is it actionable?** - Can we use these scores to make decisions?

## Expected Results

### Risk Categories

Claude will create risk buckets:

| Risk Level | Probability Range | Orders |
|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Low | 0-25% | 2,847 |
| Medium | 25-50% | 1,243 |
| High | 50-75% | 660 |
| Critical | 75-100% | 250 |

### The Key Validation

Here's the critical check - actual late rates by risk category:

| Risk Level | Predicted Range | **Actual Late Rate** |
|------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Low | 0-25% | 6.2% |
| Medium | 25-50% | 28.4% |
| High | 50-75% | 58.3% |
| Critical | 75-100% | 89.7% |

**This is great news!** The model works:

- Orders flagged as "Critical" are late **89.7%** of the time
- Orders flagged as "Low" are late only **6.2%** of the time
- The pattern is monotonic (increases consistently)

### High-Risk Order List

Claude will export something like:

| Order ID | Product | Quantity | Facility | Risk Score |
|----------|---------|----------|----------|------------|
| ORD-3847 | Art Papers | 2,500 | Sassoferrato | 94.2% |
| ORD-4012 | Security | 1,800 | Fabriano | 91.8% |
| ORD-3956 | Art Papers | 3,200 | Fabriano | 89.4% |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

This is actionable intelligence!

## What Makes This Validation Strong

### 1. Separation
The difference between Low (6.2%) and Critical (89.7%) is huge. The model clearly distinguishes risky orders.

### 2. Monotonicity
Each risk level has a higher actual late rate than the previous one. No inversions.

### 3. Business Logic
The high-risk orders make sense:
- Large quantities (harder to produce)
- Art & Design products (known to be difficult)
- Sassoferrato/Fabriano facilities (underperformers)

## Red Flags to Watch For

If you see these, the model might have problems:

- **Non-monotonic:** Medium risk has higher late rate than High
- **Poor separation:** All categories are within 5% of each other
- **Nonsensical:** Model says small orders are riskier than large

## Trust but Verify

Even with good validation:
- Don't blindly trust every prediction
- Use risk scores as guidance, not gospel
- Monitor model performance over time

## Next Step

The model is validated. Now let's turn these insights into business recommendations.
