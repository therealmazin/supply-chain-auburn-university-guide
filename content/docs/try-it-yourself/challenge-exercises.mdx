# Challenge Exercises

Ready to test yourself? Try these exercises without looking at the solutions.

## Exercise 1: Customer Analysis (Easy)

**Scenario:** Your manager wants to know which customer regions have the most problems.

**Your Task:** Write a prompt to analyze late delivery rates by customer region. Identify the top 3 worst-performing regions.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Look for a column related to customer location or region in the dataset.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sample Solution</summary>

```
Analyze late delivery rates by customer region:
1. Show late rate for each region
2. Rank regions from worst to best
3. Identify the top 3 regions with highest late rates
4. Calculate how many orders each region represents
```

## Exercise 2: Root Cause Deep Dive (Medium)

**Scenario:** Art & Design Papers have a 29.5% late rate. Management wants to know WHY.

**Your Task:** Write a prompt to investigate the root causes of late deliveries specifically for Art & Design Papers.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Filter the data to just Art & Design Papers, then analyze what makes some orders late and others on-time within that category.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sample Solution</summary>

```
Focus only on Art & Design Papers orders:
1. Filter the dataset to just this category
2. Compare late vs on-time orders - what's different?
3. Check if certain facilities handle Art Papers worse
4. Check if order size matters more for this category
5. Look for any other distinguishing factors
```

## Exercise 3: Alternative Model (Medium)

**Scenario:** Your data science team wants to compare different modeling approaches.

**Your Task:** Build a model using Random Forest instead of Gradient Boosting. Compare the results.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Simply ask for a different algorithm and request a comparison of performance metrics.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sample Solution</summary>

```
Build a Random Forest model for late delivery prediction:
1. Use the same features as before
2. Train on the same train/test split
3. Show AUC, accuracy, precision, and recall
4. Compare these metrics to the Gradient Boosting model
5. Which model performs better and why?
```

## Exercise 4: Business Impact (Hard)

**Scenario:** The CFO wants to know the financial impact of late deliveries.

**Your Task:** Calculate the estimated financial impact of late deliveries assuming:
- Each late delivery costs €660 in penalties
- Late deliveries to "Northern Italy" cost €1,200 (premium customers)
- Orders over 1,000 units that are late cost €2,500

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

You'll need to create different cost categories and sum them up appropriately.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sample Solution</summary>

```
Calculate the financial impact of late deliveries:

Assumptions:
- Base penalty: €660 per late order
- Northern Italy late orders: €1,200 per order
- Large orders (>1000 units) late: €2,500 per order

Calculate:
1. Total late orders by category
2. Apply the appropriate penalty to each
3. Sum total financial impact
4. Break down impact by product category and facility
5. Which areas contribute most to penalty costs?
```

</details>

## Exercise 5: Predictive Intervention (Hard)

**Scenario:** Operations wants to know: if we intervene on all "Critical" risk orders, how much could we save?

**Your Task:** Estimate the savings if the team successfully prevents 50% of late deliveries on Critical-risk orders.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

Use the risk scores from the model, calculate how many Critical orders would be "saved," and apply the cost assumptions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Sample Solution</summary>

```
Estimate savings from proactive intervention:

Scenario:
- We flag all Critical risk orders (probability > 75%)
- Intervention successfully prevents 50% of would-be late deliveries
- Use penalty cost of €660 per late order

Calculate:
1. How many Critical risk orders are there?
2. How many are actually late?
3. If we prevent 50% of those, how many orders are "saved"?
4. What's the financial savings?
5. What's the ROI if intervention costs €50 per order?
```

</details>

## Exercise 6: Create Your Own (Expert)

**Scenario:** Think of a question your professor or future employer might ask about this data.

**Your Task:**
1. Write down the business question
2. Create a prompt to answer it
3. Run the prompt and interpret the results
4. Write a 2-sentence executive summary

This exercise has no solution - it's your chance to think like an analyst!
