# Why AI for Supply Chain?

Supply chain management is one of the best use cases for AI. Here's why.

## The Data Explosion

Modern supply chains generate massive amounts of data:

- Orders, shipments, deliveries
- Inventory levels across locations
- Supplier performance metrics
- Customer demand patterns
- Transportation and logistics

**The problem:** Humans can't process all this data fast enough to make good decisions.

**The solution:** AI can analyze millions of data points in seconds.

## Real Business Impact

According to McKinsey research:

| AI Application | Impact |
|----------------|--------|
| Demand forecasting | 20-50% reduction in forecast errors |
| Inventory optimization | 20-30% reduction in inventory levels |
| Logistics costs | 5-20% reduction |
| Lost sales/stockouts | Up to 65% reduction |

## Common Supply Chain AI Use Cases

### 1. Demand Forecasting
Predict what customers will order, when, and how much.
- Reduces stockouts and overstock
- Improves customer satisfaction

### 2. Predictive Maintenance
Predict when equipment will fail before it happens.
- Reduces downtime
- Extends equipment life

### 3. Route Optimization
Find the most efficient delivery routes.
- Reduces fuel costs
- Faster deliveries

### 4. Risk Prediction
Identify orders or suppliers likely to have problems.
- Proactive intervention
- Fewer surprises

### 5. Supplier Evaluation
Score and rank suppliers based on performance.
- Better supplier selection
- Improved negotiations

## What We'll Focus On: Late Delivery Prediction

In this guide, we'll tackle **risk prediction** - specifically, predicting which orders will be delivered late.

This is a great starting point because:

1. **Clear business impact** - Late deliveries cost money (penalties, lost customers)
2. **Actionable results** - You can actually do something about flagged orders
3. **Relatable problem** - Every supply chain deals with this
4. **Measurable success** - Easy to track if predictions are accurate
