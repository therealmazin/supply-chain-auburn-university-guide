# Prerequisites

Before you install Claude Code, make sure you have these ready.

## What You Need

### 1. A Computer (Mac or Windows)

Claude Code works on both Mac and Windows. The instructions are slightly different, but we'll cover both.

### 2. An Anthropic Account

Claude Code is made by Anthropic. You'll need an account to use it.

**To create an account:**
1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Enter your email and create a password
4. Verify your email

### 3. API Credits

Claude Code uses credits when you run it. Anthropic gives new accounts some free credits to start.

**Checking your credits:**
1. Log in to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Click on "Billing" in the sidebar
3. You'll see your available credits

For this demo, you'll need about $1-2 in credits (which should be covered by free credits).

### 4. Basic Familiarity with Files and Folders

You should know how to:
- Find files on your computer
- Create folders
- Open applications

That's it! You don't need any coding experience.

## What's a "Terminal"?

You'll hear us mention the "terminal" a lot. Here's what it is:

**The terminal** is a text-based way to interact with your computer. Instead of clicking icons, you type commands.

Think of it like texting your computer instead of pointing at things.

| What You're Used To | What Terminal Does |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Double-click a file to open it | Type `open filename` |
| Drag file to folder | Type `mv file folder/` |
| Click "Delete" | Type `rm filename` |

**Don't worry** - Claude Code does most of the typing for you. You mainly type questions in plain English.

## Quick Check

Before moving on, confirm you have:

- [ ] A Mac or Windows computer
- [ ] An Anthropic account (or ready to create one)
- [ ] About 30 minutes of free time
