# The Business Problem

Let's understand exactly what problem we're solving.

## The Situation

Fedrigoni's converting department has a **late delivery problem**.

**Current Performance:**
- Total orders analyzed: 5,000
- On-time deliveries: 82.6%
- Late deliveries: **17.4%**

Industry target is typically **95%+ on-time delivery**.

## Why Late Deliveries Matter

### Financial Impact

Late deliveries cost money in multiple ways:

| Cost Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Penalties** | Contracts often include late fees |
| **Expedited shipping** | Rush shipping to make up for delays |
| **Lost sales** | Customers switch to competitors |
| **Reputation damage** | Word spreads in the industry |

**Estimated annual cost: €573,000** in penalties alone.

### Customer Impact

Fedrigoni's customers include major brands. When Fedrigoni is late:

- Wine labels don't arrive before harvest season
- Luxury packaging isn't ready for product launches
- Production lines at customer facilities stop

## Root Causes of Late Deliveries

Orders can be late for many reasons:

### 1. Production Complexity
- Special paper types require more processing steps
- Custom specifications slow down machines
- Quality issues require rework

### 2. Capacity Constraints
- Too many orders at certain facilities
- Machine breakdowns
- Staffing shortages

### 3. External Factors
- Supplier delays (raw materials)
- Transportation issues
- Seasonal demand spikes

### 4. Planning Issues
- Unrealistic promise dates
- Poor prioritization
- Lack of visibility into risks

## The Current Approach

Today, Fedrigoni relies on:

- **Experience** - Managers know which orders "feel" risky
- **Spreadsheets** - Manual tracking of large orders
- **Firefighting** - Reacting to problems after they happen

This reactive approach means problems are discovered too late to fix.

## The Opportunity

**What if we could predict which orders will be late before they ship?**

With early warning, the team could:

1. **Prioritize** risky orders for closer monitoring
2. **Reallocate** resources to prevent delays
3. **Communicate** proactively with customers
4. **Improve** planning for future orders

This is exactly what AI can do.
