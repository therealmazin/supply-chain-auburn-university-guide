# Step 2: Analyze Patterns

Now let's find out what makes some orders late and others on-time.

## The Prompt

Copy and paste this prompt:

```
Analyze the late delivery patterns in detail:
1. Break down late rate by product category
2. Break down late rate by facility
3. Show if order size affects late delivery rate
4. Check if there are seasonal patterns (by month)
5. Create visualizations for the most interesting findings
```

## What Claude Code Does

Claude Code will:

1. **Group the data** by different dimensions
2. **Calculate late rates** for each group
3. **Identify significant differences** between groups
4. **Create charts** to visualize the patterns

## Expected Results

### By Product Category

| Category | Orders | Late Rate |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Wine Labels | 1,250 | 8.7% |
| Luxury Packaging | 980 | 12.3% |
| Self-Adhesive | 1,100 | 18.2% |
| Art & Design Papers | 890 | 29.5% |
| Security Papers | 780 | 21.4% |

**Insight:** Art & Design Papers have 3x higher late rate than Wine Labels.

### By Facility

| Facility | Orders | Late Rate |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Verona Main | 1,800 | 11.2% |
| Arco Specialty | 1,200 | 15.8% |
| Fabriano Mill | 1,100 | 22.4% |
| Sassoferrato | 900 | 24.1% |

**Insight:** Northern facilities (Verona, Arco) outperform southern ones.

### By Order Size

| Order Size | Late Rate |
|------------|-----------|
| Small (< 100 units) | 12.1% |
| Medium (100-500) | 16.8% |
| Large (500-1000) | 21.3% |
| Very Large (> 1000) | 28.7% |

**Insight:** Bigger orders are significantly more likely to be late.

### By Month

Claude will likely show you a chart revealing:
- **Peak delay months:** March, September (seasonal rushes)
- **Best months:** January, July (lower volume periods)

## Visualizations

Claude Code will create charts like:

- **Bar chart** showing late rate by category
- **Heatmap** showing facility x month patterns
- **Scatter plot** showing order size vs. late rate

These visuals make patterns immediately obvious.

## Key Insights from This Step

1. **Product type matters** - Some products are inherently harder to deliver on time
2. **Facility matters** - Not all factories perform equally
3. **Order size matters** - Large orders are riskier
4. **Timing matters** - Seasonal patterns exist

## Business Translation

What does this mean for Fedrigoni?

- **Art & Design Papers** need extra attention or longer lead times
- **Sassoferrato facility** may need process improvements
- **Large orders** should be flagged for proactive monitoring
- **March and September** require additional capacity planning

## Next Step

We've found patterns. Now let's build a model that can predict late deliveries.
