# What is Claude Code?

Before we dive in, let's understand what CLI tools are and why they matter.

## What are CLI Tools?

**CLI (Command Line Interface)** tools are programs you run by typing commands in a terminal instead of clicking buttons. They're powerful because they can automate tasks, work with files directly, and integrate with your system.

Traditionally, CLI tools were only for developers. But AI has changed that. Now there are AI-powered CLI tools that let anyone harness the power of the command line using plain English.

## AI CLI Tools Available Today

There are several AI coding assistants available:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Claude Code** | Anthropic's CLI tool - works with local files, runs code, general purpose |
| **Gemini CLI** | Google's AI assistant - integrates with Google ecosystem |
| **OpenCode** | Open-source AI coding assistant |
| **Cursor** | AI-powered code editor with built-in assistant |
| **Aider** | Open-source AI pair programming tool |
| **Cline** | VS Code extension for AI coding |

For this guide, we'll use **Claude Code** because it's versatile, works directly with your files, and excels at data analysis tasks.

## Claude Code: Not Just for Developers

Claude Code was initially built for software developers. But here's the thing - **it can do almost anything you need**.

- Analyze spreadsheets and datasets
- Write reports and summaries
- Build predictive models
- Create visualizations
- Automate repetitive tasks

If you can describe what you want in plain English, Claude Code can probably do it.

## Not Comfortable with the Terminal?

If you're not comfortable using CLI tools or the terminal, there's an alternative:

**Claude Desktop App** - Download from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download)

When you open Claude Desktop, you'll see a **"Code" tab** (or enable it in settings). This connects Claude to your local system, giving you the same capabilities as Claude Code but with a familiar chat interface.

Think of it as the best of both worlds - the power of Claude Code without needing to learn terminal commands.

## How It's Different from ChatGPT

You've probably used ChatGPT before. Here's how Claude Code is different:

| ChatGPT | Claude Code |
|---------|-------------|
| Gives advice and answers | Actually runs code on your data |
| "Here's how you could..." | "Here are your results..." |
| General knowledge | Works with your specific files |
| One-shot responses | Back-and-forth conversation |

## What Can Claude Code Do?

For supply chain work, Claude Code can:

- **Load and analyze datasets** - Import CSV/Excel files, calculate statistics
- **Find patterns** - Identify trends, seasonality, problem areas
- **Build predictive models** - Forecast demand, predict delays
- **Create visualizations** - Charts, graphs, dashboards
- **Generate reports** - Summarize findings with business recommendations

## What It Looks Like

When you use Claude Code, you have a conversation. You type questions in plain English, and it responds with analysis:

```
You: Load the orders data and tell me what percentage are delivered late

Claude Code: I'll load and analyze the dataset...
             [Runs Python code behind the scenes]

             Results:
             - Total orders: 5,000
             - On-time: 4,132 (82.6%)
             - Late: 868 (17.4%)

             The late delivery rate is 17.4%, which is above
             the industry target of 10%.
```

## Why This Matters for Your Career

AI tools like Claude Code are transforming how businesses operate:

- **Faster analysis** - Hours of Excel work in minutes
- **Better decisions** - Data-driven insights, not gut feelings
- **Higher value work** - Focus on strategy, not number crunching

Companies are looking for business professionals who can leverage AI effectively. This skill sets you apart.
